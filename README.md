# What is this?
A modification of the games data- and pack resourcepack  that adds a new song to the game: the complete Song of Time shown of in the Triforce% run of SGDQ2022.  
This Song allows you to Time travel anywhere, removing the need to run to the Temple of Time and pull the Master Sword every Time.  
# How can I add this to my copy of The Legend of Zelda Ocarina of Time in Minecraft?  
First of all, you need a copy of the minecraft map, I'd recommend either 1.0.1 or 1.0.3,   as Im unfamiliar with the changes in later versions and have not adjusted this Modification to them.  
Download the ocarina folder, as well as resources.zip from this Github repository.  
Find your instance of the map and replace the resources.zip file in it with the resource.zip file you just downloaded.  
Now Navigate to datapacks\Legend of Zelda Data\data\ocarina_of_time\functions\items and replace the ocarina folder with the one from this repository.  
As soon as you beat the Forest Temple in your game, you'll gain acces to the Song!
